      <p>You typically think this is what your marketing agency wants to know but it’s also an important part of a website brief. Your web developers need to know the market, audience and location of the people you’re targeting so they can take that into account for design and defining country and language preferences.

        Anyone that has been developing sites long enough has a tale about a non-briefed request to add a right to left language mid-way through a website project. Even if you’re just targeting one language and one location, you’ll want to define this on your new site..</p>
